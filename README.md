# Flavor-Fields 

Welcome to **Flavor Fields**! This is a little project I created to capture the cozy, welcoming vibe of a cafe and restaurant. Think of it as a place where flavor meets comfort, now on the web!

## 📁 Project Overview

This project includes:

- **index.html** – Main structure of the site
- **style.css** – All the styling for layout and colors
- **script.js** – JavaScript for interactive features like greetings and image pop-ups
- **images** – A folder for all the images that bring the site to life

## 💡 Features

- Custom greeting that changes with the time of day
- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Click-to-enlarge images for a better look at menu items and the ambiance

## 🔧 Tools I Used

Just the basics here: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
